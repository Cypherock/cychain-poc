======

**BICYCL Implements CryptographY in CLass groups**

BICYCL is an Open Source C++ library that implements arithmetic in the ideal
class groups of imaginary quadratic fields, together with a set of cryptographic
primitives based on class groups.

The documentation is available at https://crypto.lirmm.net/bicycl


:warning: **Warning**
> The BICYCL library is a research project and is **not** production-ready.
> It should **not** be used in real cryptographic projects.
